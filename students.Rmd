### Prospective students

Are you interested in doing your bachelor's / master's thesis project with me? Feel free to get in touch to discuss this possibility!

Before sending me a request for supervision, I would like to ask you to [check out this document](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/info4supervisions/blob/main/supervision_request.md) where I detail the type of information that I need to be able to assess your request and come up with a project that best fits your profile and our shared interests.
