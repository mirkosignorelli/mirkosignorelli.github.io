Welcome! My name is **Mirko Signorelli**, and I work as an **Assistant Professor of Statistics** at Leiden University. On this website, you can find information about my research and academic activities.

### Short bio

I currently work as **assistant professor in Statistics** at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics) of [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/about-us/profile/history), where I conduct research in **biostatistics** and **computational statistics** (see next section), and I teach courses in the [Bachelor's programme in Wiskunde (Mathematics)](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelor/wiskunde) and the Master's programmes in [Mathematics](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/mathematics) and in [Statistics and Data Science](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/statistics--data-science).

I received a double PhD in Statistics from the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/profile/) (NL) and from the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/history) (IT) in 2017. After that, I worked for 4 years as Postdoctoral Researcher in Biostatistics at the [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/research/introduction) (NL).

### Research interests

My research is centered on the **development of new statistical methods** that are primarily motivated by **applied research** questions, and on the implementation of such methods in **statistical software**.  

Main research interests:

* biostatistics and biomedical applications
* computational statistics
* dynamic prediction of time to event outcomes
* high-dimensional inference
* longitudinal data analysis
* mixed effects models
* `R` programming language
* statistical network science
* survival analysis

You can find more information about my research on the [publications](publications.html) and the [R packages](r.html) pages.
